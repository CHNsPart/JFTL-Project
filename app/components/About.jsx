            Incorporated in 2015, Japan Fast Trade Ltd (JFTL) started its journey as a joint venture (JV) between Japan and Bangladesh with an aim to explore and develop new opportunities based on the resources available in the seafood segment in and around the Sundarbans, the worldâ€™s largest single terrain mangrove forest and the pride of Bangladesh. The ultimate aim being developing an economic movement in one of the remotest and disadvantaged part of Bangladesh and thereby helping local underprivileged people to have an access to economic freedom and a better way of living.

          <p className="py-2 text-md w-full pl-5 pr-2.5 text-justify">

In addition to our regular operations, we never shifted our focus from our core commitment to the development of the local society and the lifestyle of the underprivileged people. So, as part of our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), other than offering employment & training opportunities for both the genders, we regularly conduct some other social & development activities like offering Pure Drinking Water to the locals, Medical Supports, Education Scholarships, developing Road Communications, River Bank Maintenance & Protection, Sluice Gate Repair, Cyclone Recovery Program, optimized quality Rationing System for the employee, etc. Also as part of our commitment to saving the Environment, we use Effluent Treatment Plant (ETP) to treat the used processing plant water and recycle those back to the plant again.
